# Ivy

Ivy is a simulation tool that makes it possible to *design* and *simulate* cyber-physical attack over sensor networks. Moreover, Ivy provides the *quantitative evaluation* of the effects of the attacks on the application/network behavior and performances, helping the users to evaluate the overall impact of the attacks (a crucial step in the attacks ranking activity).

By using Ivy, you can:
 * design and simulate a sensor network,
 * design and run cyber-physical attacks against the sensor network,
 * measure the overall impact of the attacks on the application/network.


## Why use it

Cyber-Physical Systems are particularly prone to cyber-physical attacks. Since addressing all possible attacks is not viable, due to performance and economic reasons, it is vital to choose which attacks to address and which countermeasures to adopt. Hence, a quantitative analysis of attack impact is crucial to make an effective choice. Ivy helps the users to make this choice.
